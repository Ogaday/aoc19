# Advent of Code 2019

My solutions for [AoC2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019).

Each module contains the solution for a single puzzle. For instances, for the
solution to part II, day 13, run:

```
python -m day_13_2
```

Input data is expected in the `input/` directory. For instance, the puzzle
input for day 4 is expected to be saved to `input/day_4.txt`.

Requires `Python 3.8`.
